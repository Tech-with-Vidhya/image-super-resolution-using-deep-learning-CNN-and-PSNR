# image-super-resolution-using-deep-learning-CNN-and-PSNR
This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program internal training for the module named “Deep Learning and Computer Vision” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.  This project aims to obtain practical knowledge and hands-on understanding of the concepts of image super-resolution, deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).   The project addresses 3 different problem statements and use cases; with the solutions implemented using Python and its module named PyTorch.
